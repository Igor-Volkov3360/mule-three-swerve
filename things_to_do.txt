intake: 
    1- check the codeðŸ˜…

    2- check if the encoders' 0 are actually 0
        if they are not ajust the offsets

    3- 
    
elevator:
    1- create a bunch of variable that are related to the height of all the stages
    1.1- link the variables to the custom controller buttons

    2- start a little sequence when we lift the elevator: 1) sligthly open the intake 2) elevate 3) retract elevator 4) retract intake

    3-

gripper:
    1- control it using the current drawn from the pdp to know when its closing on a game piece (opening and closing)
    1.1- make sure that there's two values, one for the cones one for the cubes

    2- control the angle of the gripper using the ecoders, maybe with a variable that is stored when the robot initially power up
       and then it move from a pre-determined values 

    3- 

spindexer:
    1- wait for the mechanic boys to change the gearing ratios because its a quick boi

    2- figure out a way to know when a cone is in there, will most likely be a ultasonic sensor

    3- 

rgb panel: 
    1- fix the broken connection (jay)

    2- when we are not aligned its red, when we are aligned its green( to the april tags)

    3- map 2 buttons that are telling the human player if its a cone (yellow) or a cube (purple)

    4-

drivetrain:
    1- ask PL what should be the differents autonomous modes
    1.1- write them down
    1.2- make them
    1.3- create a selector in the shuffleboard to choose which autonomous mode the they want to run

    2- automatically align the robot using the apriltags and reset the odometry at the same time so the robot doesnt suffer from drift
